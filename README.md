# React-simple-todo-list

This project is built on react JS. I've used visual studio code and node JS to create this project. This is very basic app which perform basic to-do stuff.

this is my first react app and I started learning react from YouTube channel called traversy media.

since I built background justice crash course video is not have any advanced operation then just learning of basic react JS.

I really feel like white and Lisa to learn which is being used widely by the industry.
